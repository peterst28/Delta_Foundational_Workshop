# MAGIC ## Building a Lakehouse with Delta Lake
# MAGIC In the Databricks Academy course *Fundamentals of Delta Lake*,
# MAGIC we discussed Enterprise Decision Support Systems (EDSS) and their use
# MAGIC in Online Analytics Processing (OLAP).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In particular, we reviewed how using Delta Lake technology can help
# MAGIC build a robust Lakehouse, a single sources of truth to help organizations
# MAGIC make intelligent, data-driven business decisions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In this course, we go from theory to practice.

# MAGIC ## An Internet of Things Data Ingestion Pipeline
# MAGIC In this course, we will use Apache Spark and Delta Lake to:
# MAGIC - Ingest data
# MAGIC - Create a table that will serve as a single source of truth
# MAGIC - Build a downstream aggregate table on this single source of truth
# MAGIC - Use Delta Lake to perform operations  on the table to make our data more robust

# MAGIC ### Internet of Things (IoT) Data
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The domain of this course is the Internet of Things (IoT).
# MAGIC In particular, we will be using simulated health tracker data passing
# MAGIC easurements of a userâ€™s heart rate once an hour. Such a pipeline might appear as follows:

# MAGIC ### Components of The System
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - High Flux Event Data - Heart rates are recorded by user devices.
# MAGIC - Operational Data Store (ODS) - The transactional database records all measurements.
# MAGIC - ETL - On some timeframe, this data is made available to an ETL process for loading into an EDSS.
# MAGIC - Enterprise Decision Support System (EDSS) - Data is loaded into a Delta table and is the Single Source of Truth.
# MAGIC - Online Analytics Processing (OLAP) - Delta Lake is used to manage and analyze the Single Source of Truth and downstream aggregate tables.
